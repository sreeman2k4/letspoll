                <p>1 Voting Administrators
              The board of the KDE e.V. assigns one or more voting administrators which are responsible for technically performing the voting. This includes sending out the ballots, receiving the votes, calculating and publishing the results.
              
              The voting administrators must not disclose any information about the identity of the voters or any other information which isn't contained in the published voting results.
              </p><br>


             <p> 2 General procedure for online voting
              An online voting is initiated by a voting proposal followed by a discussion period. After the discussion period the voting period is started. The voting is finished by calculating and publishing the voting results.
              
              Results of online votes are effective immediately following publication of the results unless otherwise stated in the voting proposal.
            </p><br>
             <p> 2.1 Voting Proposal
              An online voting is initiated by a proposal for voting which states the subject of the voting. The proposal is sent by email to the membership mailing list and has to include exact and complete information what is voted upon. Only the information which is directly included in the mail sent as voting proposal is subject of the voting.
              
              The voting proposal email has to explicitly be marked as voting proposal by starting the email subject line with the string "Voting Proposal:".
              
              Any active member can initiate a voting by sending a voting proposal.
              
              The member who has initiated a vote can retract the voting proposal by sending an email to the membership list stating the intention to retract the proposal.
              
              A proposal can only be retracted within the discussion period.
            </p><br>
              <p>2.2 Discussion Period
              The discussion period begins on the date the membership mailing list receives the voting proposal. Unless specified otherwise in the procedures for the specific type of vote (see: Types of Votes), the discussion period lasts for two weeks. The discussion period should be used to discuss the voting and form opinions about the options which are available for voting.
            </p><br>
             <p> 2.3 Start of Voting
              When the discussion period has finished the voting is started by sending ballots to all active members. The ballots should include the text of the proposal which is voted about.
            </p><br>
              <p>2.4 Voting Period
              The voting period is started by sending out the ballots. Unless specified otherwise in the procedures for the specific type of vote (see: Types of Votes), the voting period lasts for two weeks. During the voting period the active members cast their votes. Only votes cast within the voting period are considered for the results of the voting.
            </p><br> 
             <p> 2.5 End of Voting
              After the voting period all cast votes are counted and the results of the voting are published.
             </p><br> 
             <p> The results of a vote are published to the KDE e.V. membership by sending them to the membership mailing list. They have to include the number of persons permitted to vote, the total number of votes, and the number of votes for each available voting option. The results should also include a statement, if the voting was valid according to section 5.
